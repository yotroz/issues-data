# issues-data

Hello! This file takes you step by step of how the issues data was handled for this first iteration. 

# Environment

There's three files: two csvs and a Jupyter Notebook. 

The easiest way to get everything up and running to reproduce the results is by: 

  1. downloading/booting up the Anaconda-Navigator.
  3. downloading the .ipnyb file
  2. downloading the csvs in the same folder
  4. Once inside the Anaconda Navigator, look for the folder and open the Notebook file. 
  5. Make sure the csvs are correctly referenced after the imports section
  6. You can now start to run the commands with ctrl + enter (or click the 'Run' button on the top tool bar). 

If you only wish to read the process, Github has a Jupyter Notebook displayer.
